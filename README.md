### Why We Did What We Did
We decided to use the FreeBSD License under Creative Commons because it was a very permissible license with little needed for a user to use our program. Our program is meant to increase voter turnout and democracy literacy.

We decided to make the CoC purely about following the rules of the program itself because the point of the program is to inform the user about their voter qualifications.
